1. What is an Object?
Object is an instance of a class.

2. What is a Class?
Class is a blueprint which contains states and behaviours. 
It is a objective for the creation of object.

3. What is variables? why we use variables?
Variables are the containers which contains the different types of data.
we use variables to store data or assign values.

4. What are instance variables?
Instance variables are non static variables declared inside the class outside the main method.

5. What is a static variable?
Static variables are variables declared uisng static keyword within the class outside the method.

6. What is the difference between class variable and instance variable?

class variables :  
* These variables can be accessed by calling the class name , object creation is not required.                                  
* These are also known as static variables which are declared using static keyword within the class outside the method .
instance variables :
*These varaibles are also known as global variables declared within the class outside the method.
*These variables can be accessed through objects creation using new keyword by creating reference variable.                                           

7. How will you create an object? with example?
To create an object we use new keyword and class name.

Ex: class Industries{
    	String name;
    	String type;
		Public static void main(String []a){
			Industries i = new Industries();
			System.out.println(i.name);
			System.out.println(i.type);
		}
	}
// output
null 
null

8. What is a method?
method are basically functions which perform specific tasks or the block of code which specifies the task to be performed.
methods are declared by method name followed by parentheses, in which we can pass values which are also known as parameters.

9. what is method overloading? 
The methods within a class having same name but different type of parameters is known as method overloading. 

Practical
10 method overloading
class calculator{
	 static int add(int a,intb){
		return a+b;
	}
        static double add(double a, double b, double c){
		return a+b+c;
	}
		public static void main(String []a){
			System.out.println(calculator.add(11,7));
			System.out.println(calculator.add(4,7,9));
	}
}
// output
18
20
11. print month of year
class monthsSwitchCase{
	public static void main(String[]args){
		int n=12;
		switch(n){
		case 1:
		System.out.println("January");
		break;
		case 2:
		System.out.println("Feburary");
		break;
		case 3:
		System.out.println("March");
		break;
		case 4:
		System.out.println("April");
		break;
		case 5:
		System.out.println("May");
		break;
		case 6:
		System.out.println("June");
		break;
		case 7:
		System.out.println("July");
		break;
		case 8:
		System.out.println("August");
		break;
		case 9:
		System.out.println("September");
		break;
		case 10:
		System.out.println("October");
		break;
		case 11:
		System.out.println("November");
		break;
		case 12:
		System.out.println("December");
		break;
		
		default:
		System.out.println("Invalid number");
		
		}
	}
}

// output 
December

12. factorial 
class Factorial{
	public static void main(String []a){
		int i, fact=;
		int numbere=5;
			for(i=1;i<=number;i++){
				fact=fact*i;
			}
System.out.println("Factorial of"+number+"is" +fact);
}
}
