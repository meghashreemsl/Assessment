weekly assessment 3

1. DB means database. Database is used to store data large data in one place. 

It is used to store, add, delete, update data ,basically used for data manipulation.

2. DBMS :Database management system is a software used to store,retreive ,manage data.
RDMS: Relational database management system it stores data in tables.

DBMS: 
*It stores data as file.
* It deals with small data , it supports single user.
*DBMS does not apply any security with regards to data.
*Examples for DBMS are file systems, xml etc
*does not support distributed database.

RDBMS:
*RDBMS store data in tabular form.
*The tables have unique identifier called primary key, and alos it has foreign key,it acts as a reference variable of primary key.(foriegn key is usually used when we have multiple tables.
*The data is stored in the form of tables.
*It support distributed database.
*Examples for RDBMS : MYSQL,postgre,SQL,server,oracle etc


3.SQL :structure query language :It is a computer languages which gives instructions to the database.It allows to access and manupilate the databases.

It is used show data from a database. 
It is used to manage the  database.
it is use to modify the data 
It is used to insert the data
It is used to create functions ,views and stored procedures.

SQL is used as DDL (dat definition language) which means you can automatically data base can be created.
SQL is used as DML (Data Manipulation Language ) it can be used for keeping the previously existing database, so it is widely used to  enter information , change information with respect to database.

examples : we use SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT,WHERE


4 jdbc : java database Connectivity : it is an application programming interface(API) , it is used to for java database connectivity.
API helps to interact  with another application , backbone for api is abstraction , used to achieve loose coupling with the help of interface.
STEPS IN JDBC
1 load and register the driver
2 Establish the connection with DB server.
3.create a statement or a platform 
4. Execute the query 
5. Close all the connections.


5  OOPS: It is object oriented programming system , it uses objects and classes it provides many concepts like inheritance,encapsulation, polymorphism.
inheritance : its i acquiring the properties of another class ex: http servlet is abstract class which extends generic servlet.
abstraction :it is creating interface class and writing only the methods not showing the implementation.so interface class contains only the methods without implemntation.ex: Statement is an interface
encapsulation : it is binding the data, basically the data members are made private ,it consists of default constructor , setters and getter methods ex: DTO class
polymorphism : object acting differently in different instances ex toString method is used for overriding

6 runtime polymorphism : method overriding occurs at run time 
ex: doPost() method , toString method 
compile time polymorphism: method overloading  occurs at compile time.ex : wait(), wait(arg0,arg1), wait(arg0,arg1,arg3) 


7.constructor is a special type of method which has the name same as classname.
two types of constructor: 1. default constructor : it does not have any paramter. 
ex: public class voter{
public class voter(){
}
2. parametrized constructor : it is a constructor which has arguments.
public class voter{
public class voter(int age){
}

construtor chaining is calling another constructor using this keyword.

8.Mysql is database management system , it ia relational database management system based on sql 
It is used for adding,accessing and managing the data in database.

9.and 10: .create schema wolken;
create table movie_details(
id int not null,
title varchar(20),
category varchar(20),
language varchar(45),

primarykey(id)

);

create table movie_member(
id int not null,
first_name varchar(20),
last_name varchar(20),
movie_id int 
age int
primarykey(id)
 foreign key(movie_id) references movie_details(id),
);


10. insert into(id,first_name,last_name,movie_id,age)
values(1,"Adam","Smith",1,20),
(2,"Ravi","kumar",2,19),
(3,"susan","davidson",5,17),
(4,"")
);
         
11. select * from movie_details left join movie_members on movie_members.Id = movie_details.Id;

12.select * from movie_details right join movie_members on movie_members.Id = movie_details.Id;

13. select * from movie_members where Id=4;

14. select * from movie_members where Id=4;

15. select * from movie_members, movies_details where movie_members.Id = movie_details_Id;

16.select * from movie_details right join movie_members on movie_members.Id = movie_details.Id; 

17.select distinct * from  movie_members;

select distinct * from  movie_details;
